What then did Agrippinus say?  He said, "I am not a hindrance to
myself."  When it was reported to him that his trial was going on in the
Senate, he said: "I hope it may turn out well; but it is the fifth hour
of the day"--this was the time when he was used to exercise himself and
then take the cold bath,--"let us go and take our exercise."  After he
had taken his exercise, one comes and tells him, "You have been
condemned."  "To banishment," he replies, "or to death?"  "To
banishment."  "What about my property?"  "It is not taken from you."
"Let us go to Aricia then," he said, "and dine."

And yet God has not only given us these faculties, by which we shall be
able to bear everything that happens without being depressed or broken
by it; but, like a good king and a true father, He has given us these
faculties free from hindrance, subject to no compulsion, unimpeded, and
has put them entirely in our own power, without even having reserved to
Himself any power of hindering or impeding.  You, who have received
these powers free and as your own, use them not; you do not even see
what you have received, and from whom; some of you being blinded to the
giver, and not even acknowledging your benefactor, and others, through
meanness of spirit, betaking yourselves to fault-finding and making
charges against God.

With respect to gods, there are some who say that a divine being does
not exist; others say that it exists, but is inactive and careless, and
takes no forethought about anything; a third class say that such a being
exists and exercises forethought, but only about great things and
heavenly things, and about nothing on the earth; a fourth class say that
a divine being exercises forethought both about things on the earth and
heavenly things, but in a general way only, and not about things
severally.  There is a fifth class to whom Ulysses and Socrates belong,
who say:

This is the law of nature and of God that the superior shall always

In every act consider what precedes and what follows, and then proceed
to the act.  If you do not consider, you will at first begin with
spirit, since you have not thought at all of the things which follow;
but afterwards when some consequences have shown themselves, you will
basely desist (from that which you have begun).--I wish to conquer at
the Olympic games.--(And I too, by the gods; for it is a fine thing.)
But consider here what precedes and what follows; and then, if it is for
your good, undertake the thing.  You must act according to rules, follow
strict diet, abstain from delicacies, exercise yourself by compulsion at
fixed times, in heat, in cold; drink no cold water, nor wine, when there
is opportunity of drinking it.  In a word, you must surrender yourself
to the trainer, as you do to a physician.  Next in the contest, you must
be covered with sand, sometimes dislocate a hand, sprain an ankle,
swallow a quantity of dust, be scourged with the whip; and after
undergoing all this, you must sometimes be conquered.  After reckoning
all these things, if you have still an inclination, go to the athletic
practice.  If you do not reckon them, observe you will behave like
children who at one time play as wrestlers, then as gladiators, then
blow a trumpet, then act a tragedy, when they have seen and admired such
things.  So you also do: you are at one time a wrestler (athlete), then
a gladiator, then a philosopher, then a rhetorician; but with your whole
soul you are nothing: like the ape you imitate all that you see; and
always one thing after another pleases you, but that which becomes
familiar displeases you.  For you have never undertaken anything after
consideration, nor after having explored the whole matter and put it to
a strict examination; but you have undertaken it at hazard and with a
cold desire.

Of things some are in our power, and others are not.  In our power are
opinion, movement towards a thing, desire, aversion, turning from a
thing; and in a word, whatever are our acts.  Not in our power are the
body, property, reputation, offices, and in a word, whatever are not our
own acts.  And the things in our power are by nature free, not subject
to restraint or hindrance; but the things not in our power are weak,
slavish, subject to restraint, in the power of others.  Remember then,
that if you think the things which are by nature slavish to be free, and
the things which are in the power of others to be your own, you will be
hindered, you will lament, you will be disturbed, you will blame both
gods and men; but if you think that only which is your own to be your
own, and if you think that what is another's, as it really is, belongs
to another, no man will ever compel you, no man will hinder you, you
will never blame any man, you will accuse no man, you will do nothing
involuntarily (against your will), no man will harm you, you will have
no enemy, for you will not suffer any harm.

Remember that desire contains in it the profession (hope) of obtaining
that which you desire; and the profession (hope) in aversion (turning
from a thing) is that you will not fall into that which you attempt to
avoid; and he who fails in his desire is unfortunate; and he who falls
into that which he would avoid is unhappy.  If then you attempt to avoid
only the things contrary to nature which are within your power you will
not be involved in any of the things which you would avoid.  But if you
attempt to avoid disease, or death, or poverty, you will be unhappy.
Take away then aversion from all things which are not in our power, and
transfer it to the things contrary to nature which are in our power.

with more safety you will undertake the matter, if you say to yourself,

brought around to you?  Put out your hand and take your share with

Don't stretch your desire towards it, but wait till it reaches you.  Do
this with regard to children, to a wife, to public posts, to riches, and
you will eventually be a worthy partner of the feasts of the gods.  And
if you don't even take the things which are set before you, but are able
even to reject them, then you will not only be a partner at the feasts

appearance.  For if the nature of the good is in our power, neither envy
nor jealousy will have a place in us.  But you yourself will not wish to

We may learn the wish (will) of nature from the things in which we do

your cup also is broken, you ought to think as you did when your
neighbor's cup was broken.  Transfer this reflection to greater things
also.  Is another man's child or wife dead?  There is no one who would
not say, This is an event incident to man.  But when a man's own child

unfavorable opinion about it.  For if it is not right to do it, avoid
doing the thing; but if it is right, why are you afraid of those who
shall find fault wrongly?

As the proposition, it is either day, or it is night, is of great
importance for the disjunctive argument, but for the conjunctive, is of
no value, so in a symposium (entertainment) to select the larger share
is of great value for the body, but for the maintenance of the social
feeling is worth nothing.  When, then, you are eating with another,
remember, to look not only to the value for the body of the things set
before you, but also to the value of the behavior towards the host which
ought to be observed.

If you have assumed a character above your strength, you have both acted
in this manner in an unbecoming way, and you have neglected that which
you might have fulfilled.

In walking about, as you take care not to step on a nail, or to sprain
your foot, so take care not to damage your own ruling faculty; and if we
observe this rule in every act, we shall undertake this act with more
security.

The measure of possession (property) is to every man the body, as the
foot is of the shoe.  If then you stand on this rule (the demands of the
body), you will maintain the measure; but if you pass beyond it, you
must then of necessity be hurried as it were down a precipice.  As also
in the matter of the shoe, if you go beyond the (necessities of the)
foot, the shoe is gilded, then of a purple color, then embroidered; for
there is no limit to that which has once passed the true measure.

Women forthwith from the age of fourteen are called by the men
mistresses.  Therefore, since they see that there is nothing else that
they can obtain, but only the power of lying with men, they begin to
decorate themselves, and to place all their hopes in this.  It is worth
our while then to take care that they may know that they are valued (by
men) for nothing else than appearing (being) decent and modest and
discreet.

It is a mark of a mean capacity to spend much time on the things which
concern the body, such as much exercise, much eating, much drinking,
much easing of the body, much copulation.  But these things should be
done as subordinate things; and let all your care be directed to the
mind.

When any person treats you ill or speaks ill of you, remember that he
does this or says this because he thinks that it is his duty.  It is not
possible then for him to follow that which seems right to you, but that
which seems right to himself.  Accordingly if he is wrong in his
opinion, he is the person who is hurt, for he is the person who has been
deceived; for if a man shall suppose the true conjunction to be false,
it is not the conjunction which is hindered, but the man who has been
deceived about it.  If you proceed then from these opinions, you will be
mild in temper to him who reviles you; for say on each occasion, It
seemed so to him.

Everything has two handles, the one by which it may be carried, the other

These reasonings do not cohere: I am richer than you, therefore I am
better than you; I am more eloquent than you, therefore I am better than
you.  On the contrary, these rather cohere: I am richer than you,
therefore my possessions are greater than yours; I am more eloquent than
you, therefore my speech is superior to yours.  But you are neither
possession nor speech.

Does a man bathe quickly (early)?  do not say that he bathes badly, but
that he bathes quickly.  Does a man drink much wine?  do not say that he
does this badly, but say that he drinks much.  For before you shall have
determined the opinion how do you know whether he is acting wrong?  Thus
it will not happen to you to comprehend some appearances which are
capable of being comprehended, but to assent to others.

On no occasion call yourself a philosopher, and do not speak much among
the uninstructed about theorems; but do that which follows from them.
For example, at a banquet do not say how a man ought to eat, but eat as
you ought to eat.

When at a small cost you are supplied with everything for the body, do
not be proud of this; nor, if you drink water, say on every occasion, I
drink water.  But consider first how much more frugal the poor are than
we, and how much more enduring of labor.  And if you ever wish to
exercise yourself in labor and endurance, do it for yourself, and not
for others.

The condition and characteristic of an uninstructed person is this: he
never expects from himself profit (advantage) nor harm, but from
externals.  The condition and characteristic of a philosopher is this:
he expects all advantage and all harm from himself.

When a man is proud because he can understand and explain the writings
of Chrysippus, say to yourself, If Chrysippus had not written obscurely,
this man would have had nothing to be proud of.  But what is it that I
wish?  To understand nature and to follow it.  I inquire therefore who
is the interpreter?  and when I have heard that it is Chrysippus, I come
to him (the interpreter).  But I do not understand what is written, and
therefore I seek the interpreter.  And so far there is yet nothing to be
proud of.  But when I shall have found the interpreter, the thing that
remains is to use the precepts (the lessons).  This itself is the only
thing to be proud of.  But if I shall admire the exposition, what else
have I been made unless a grammarian instead of a philosopher?  except
in one thing, that I am explaining Chrysippus instead of Homer.  When,
then, any man says to me, Read Chrysippus to me, I rather blush, when I
cannot show my acts like to and consistent with his words.

The first and most necessary place in philosophy is the use of theorems,
for instance, that we must not lie; the second part is that of
demonstrations, for instance, How is it proved that we ought not to lie?
The third is that which is confirmatory of these two, and explanatory,
for example, How is this a demonstration?  For what is demonstration,
what is consequence, what is contradiction, what is truth, what is
falsehood?  The third part is necessary on account of the second, and
the second on account of the first; but the most necessary and that on
which we ought to rest is the first.  But we do the contrary.  For we
spend our time on the third topic, and all our earnestness is about it;
but we entirely neglect the first.  Therefore we lie; but the
demonstration that we ought not to lie we have ready to hand.

In every thing (circumstance) we should hold these maxims ready to hand:

  Lead me, O Zeus, and thou O Destiny, The way that I am bid by you to
  go: To follow I am ready.  If I choose not, I make myself a wretch,
  and still must follow.

  But whoever nobly yields unto necessity, We hold him wise, and skill'd
  in things divine.
